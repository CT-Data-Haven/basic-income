## Working with data {.smaller}

| Pros                                                       | Cons                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speaking the language of funders, politicians, etc         | Do funders & community use same language?              |
| Assumed based on facts                                     | Facts depend on context & can be skewed                |
| Can give background to lived experience & shared knowledge | Often treated as more important than lived experiences |
| Valuable skills once you get them                          | High barrier                                           |
| "Now what I've seen makes sense!"                              | "Tell me something I don't know!"                      |
