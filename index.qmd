## Working with data {.smaller}

| Pros                                                       | Cons                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Speaking the **language** of funders, politicians, etc         | Does the community speak that language?              |
| Assumed based on **facts**                                     | Facts depend on context & can be skewed                |
| Can give **background** to lived experience & shared knowledge | Often treated as more important than lived experiences |
| Valuable **skills**... once you get them                          | High bar to learn                                      |
| "Now **what I've seen** makes sense!"                          | "Tell me something I don't know!"                      |
